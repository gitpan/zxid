This is the perl module hierarchy for libzxid.

It is included inside zxid distribution, zxid-0.x.tgz. Net::SAML and
ZXID are further described in README.zxid and on web at zxid.org

Install
=======

* Generally you should follow the README.zxid instructions
* The perl specific part (after compiling libzxid) is more or less

     cd zxid/Net
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test      # Very sparse tests, sorry
     make install

* If you want low level perl interfaces to encoders and decoders

     cd zxid/Raw
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test      # Very sparse tests, sorry
     make install

  WARNING: Low level interface is baroque, and consequently, it
  will take a lot of disk space, RAM and CPU to build it: 100 MB
  would not be exageration and over an hour (on 1GHz CPU). Build
  time memory consumption of single cc1 process will be over
  256 MB of RAM. You have been warned.

* If you want low level perl interfaces to metadata

     cd zxid/Metadata
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make test      # Very sparse tests, sorry
     make install

  WARNING: This is also very heavy to build.

Current major modules are
=========================

* Net::SAML - The high level interfaces for Single Sign-On (SSO)
* Net::SAML::Raw - Low level assertion and protocol manipulation interfaces
* Net::SAML::Metadata - Low level metadata manipulation interfaces

Planned modules
===============

* Net::WSF - The high level interfaces for Web Services Frameworks (WSF)
* Net::WSF::Raw - The low level interfaces for WSF variants
